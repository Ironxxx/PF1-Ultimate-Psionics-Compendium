This ability allows you to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. With the scent ability, you can identify familiar odors just as humanoids do familiar sights.</p><p>You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.</p><p>When you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever you come within 5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the source's location.</p><p>You can follow tracks by smell, making a Survival check to find or follow a track.

A psionic aura is given off by any active or permanent power, or during the use of any psionic feat. Characters who have levels in a psionic class, creatures with the psionic subtype, and creatures with the Wild Talent feat possess psionic auras. The amount of information revealed by the manifestation of this power depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.</p>\n<p><strong>1st Round:</strong> Presence or absence of psionic auras.</p>\n<p><strong>2nd Round:</strong> Number of different psionic auras and the strength of the most potent aura.</p>\n<p><strong>3rd Round: </strong>The strength and location of each aura.</p>\n<p>If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (psionics) checks to determine the discipline involved in each aura. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + power level, or 15 + one-half manifester level for an effect that is not created by a power, such as that of a psionic item.) If the aura emanates from a psionic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).</p>\n<p>Psionically charged locations, multiple disciplines, or strong local psionic emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras.</p>\n<p><strong>Aura Strength</strong>: A psionic aura&rsquo;s strength depends on a functioning power&rsquo;s level or an item&rsquo;s manifester level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect psionics indicates the stronger of the two.

You must manifest this power in response to a single attack made with a ranged weapon within medium range (the attacker must be within range, the target need not be) before the result of the attack is determined. You cannot use this power to mirror unusually massive projectiles such as siege weapons. You create four reflections of the projectile that each do damage as a mundane weapon of the original projectile's type. Each mirrored projectile uses the same attack roll result as the reflected attack to determine if they strike the target or not (regardless of their enhancement bonus to attack), and each projectile checks for concealment individually. Effects that modify the weapon or its damage, such as that from Psionic Shot or prevenom weapon, do not apply to these reflections.</p><p>If applicable, the projectiles add the Strength bonus of the original attacker under the normal constraints for the attacker's weapon (full strength bonus for thrown weapons, full strength bonus up to a certain value for composite longbows, etc). The reflections return to their native reality shortly after appearing and cannot be preserved.</p><p>Precision damage (such as sneak attack) and extra damage from critical hits only apply to the first projectile fired, not to the four reflections. The four mirrored projectiles bypass damage reduction as though they were magic weapons.</p><p><b>Augment:</b> You may augment this power in one or more of the following ways:</p><p>1. By spending additional power points, you may reflect enhancement bonuses or magic abilities of the initial projectile. For every 2 additional power points you spend, you may bestow the reflections with the equivalent of an additional +1 enhancement bonus or ability priced as a +1 bonus.

Each additional power point spent allows you to affect one additional object before the power ends, although this cannot allow you to make more attacks in a standard attack or full attack than normal.</p><p>2. For every 2 additional power points you spend, the size of an object you can affect with this power increases one step.</p><p>3. For every additional power point you spend, the power's duration extends 1 round. The number of objects you can alter this way remains unchanged, and the power still ends when these run out.</p><p>Additionally, every additional power point spent to achieve any of these effects allows for your trick shots to be described in sentences of up to one word longer.</p>","spellDuration":"1 round or until discharged","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","showInQuickbar":false,"spellPoints":{"cost":"(@sl * 2) - 1"},"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/light-magenta-2.jpg","effects":[]}

A dispelled power ends as if its duration had expired. Some Powers, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel Psionics. Dispel Psionics can dispel (but not counter) psi-like effects just as it does Powers. The effect of a power with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the psionic effect is already over before the dispel Psionics can take effect.</p><p><b>Targeted Dispel</b></p><p>One object, creature, or power is the target of the dispel Psionics power. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level) and compare that to the power with highest manifester level (DC = 11 + the power's manifester level). If successful, that power ends. If not, compare the same result to the power with the next highest manifester level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one power affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every power.</p><p>For example, a 7th-level manifester manifests dispel Psionics, targeting a creature affected by biofeedback (manifester level 12th) and flight (manifester level 7th). The manifester level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the biofeedback (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the flight (which only required a 18). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the biofeedback would have been dispelled, leaving the flight intact. Had the dispel check been a 17 or less, no powers would have been affected.</p><p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one power affecting the target or one power affecting an area (such as a <i>wall of fire</i>). You must name the specific power effect to be targeted in this way. If your manifester level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that power, it ends.

A dispelled power ends as if its duration had expired. Some Powers, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel Psionics. Dispel Psionics can dispel (but not counter) psi-like effects just as it does Powers. The effect of a power with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the psionic effect is already over before the dispel Psionics can take effect.</p><p><b>Targeted Dispel</b></p><p>One object, creature, or power is the target of the dispel Psionics power. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level) and compare that to the power with highest manifester level (DC = 11 + the power's manifester level). If successful, that power ends. If not, compare the same result to the power with the next highest manifester level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one power affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every power.</p><p>For example, a 7th-level manifester manifests dispel Psionics, targeting a creature affected by biofeedback (manifester level 12th) and flight (manifester level 7th). The manifester level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the biofeedback (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the flight (which only required a 18). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the biofeedback would have been dispelled, leaving the flight intact. Had the dispel check been a 17 or less, no powers would have been affected.</p><p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one power affecting the target or one power affecting an area (such as a <i>wall of fire</i>). You must name the specific power effect to be targeted in this way. If your manifester level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that power, it ends. No other powers or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power (such as a monster summoned by <i>summon monster</i>), you make a dispel check to end the power that conjured the object or creature.</p><p>If the object that you target is a psionic item, you make a dispel check against the item's manifester level (DC = 11 + the item's manifester level).

If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks—you simply have two claw attacks at your normal attack bonus. You may use secondary natural attacks as normal when using your claw attacks as part of a full attack.</p><p>You can call or dismiss the claws as a swift action during the duration of the power.

If your new size is Tiny, you have a space of 2 1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that you must enter an opponent's square to attack). If your new size is Diminutive, you have a space of 1 foot and a natural reach of 0 feet. If your size decreases to Medium, you have a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet. This power doesn't change your speed. All your equipment, worn or carried, is similarly reduced by the power. Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other psionic or magical properties are not affected by this power. Any affected item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them). Multiple effects that reduce size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second manifestation of this power to further reduce yourself.</p><p><b>Augment:</b> You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.</p><p>1. If you spend 6 additional power points, this power decreases your size by two size categories. You gain a +4 size bonus to Dexterity, a -4 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum effective Strength score of 1), a +2 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 size bonus to Armor Class due to your reduced size.</p><p>2. If you spend 6 additional power points, you can manifest this power as a swift action instead of a standard action.</p><p>3. If you spend 2 additional power points, this power's duration is minutes per level rather than minute per level.</p>","spellDuration":"minute/level (D)","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","showInQuickbar":false,"spellPoints":{"cost":"(@sl * 2) - 1"},"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/light-magenta-2.jpg","effects":[]}

The storm itself manifests as a wall which can intensify the existing winds in a small area, or can instead be set to exactly counter such winds, generating a peaceful area of calm. While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square walls to enclose specific points.</p><p>Choose to intensify or pacify the winds when you manifest this power (although the decision can be changed when you reshape the effect, see below). Intensifying the winds creates an invisible vertical curtain of wind. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Flying creatures smaller than Medium size cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. </p><p>Projectiles of 1 pound or less passing through the wind wall are deflected upward and miss. For every pound above 1 of the projectile's weight, it has a 10% chance to not be blown off course. Projectiles weighing 10 lbs or more are unaffected by the wind wall. Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).</p><p>Pacifying the winds allows you to generate a region of calm that consists of every 5 ft. cube that shares an edge or space with where the wind wall would otherwise be. These regions are treated as if their wind conditions were two categories fairer than they would naturally be, to a minimum of no winds. Additionally, if these areas of calm overlap an existing wind wall or an intensifying localized windstorm, the two effects cancel, letting normal wind conditions prevail in the square.</p><p>At any point during the duration, you may extend your concentration to a full-round action. Doing so allows you reshape the wall into any other configuration you could have chosen when you manifest this power, including the choice to intensify or pacify.</p><p><b>Augment:</b> You may augment this power in one or more of the following ways:</p><p>1. If you spend 2 additional power points, the duration increases to 1 rnd./lvl.. You no longer need to maintain concentration. You may reshape the wall by spending a standard action in concentration.</p><p>2. If you spend 2 additional power points, the range of this power increases to Medium (100 ft. +10 ft./lvl.).</p><p>3. If you spend 2 additional power points, your control over the localized windstorm increases greatly. You may reshape the wall as normal or as an immediate action. You may also generate pockets of calm interspersed with pockets of intense winds when you shape the wall (effectively, this is the intensify option except that the wall may be broken with as many 5-foot cubes of calm that you choose, as per the pacify option). </p><p>4.

The storm itself manifests as a wall which can intensify the existing winds in a small area, or can instead be set to exactly counter such winds, generating a peaceful area of calm. While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square walls to enclose specific points.</p><p>Choose to intensify or pacify the winds when you manifest this power (although the decision can be changed when you reshape the effect, see below). Intensifying the winds creates an invisible vertical curtain of wind. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Flying creatures smaller than Medium size cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. </p><p>Projectiles of 1 pound or less passing through the wind wall are deflected upward and miss. For every pound above 1 of the projectile's weight, it has a 10% chance to not be blown off course. Projectiles weighing 10 lbs or more are unaffected by the wind wall. Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures).</p><p>Pacifying the winds allows you to generate a region of calm that consists of every 5 ft. cube that shares an edge or space with where the wind wall would otherwise be. These regions are treated as if their wind conditions were two categories fairer than they would naturally be, to a minimum of no winds. Additionally, if these areas of calm overlap an existing wind wall or an intensifying localized windstorm, the two effects cancel, letting normal wind conditions prevail in the square.</p><p>At any point during the duration, you may extend your concentration to a full-round action. Doing so allows you reshape the wall into any other configuration you could have chosen when you manifest this power, including the choice to intensify or pacify.</p><p><b>Augment:</b> You may augment this power in one or more of the following ways:</p><p>1. If you spend 2 additional power points, the duration increases to 1 rnd./lvl.. You no longer need to maintain concentration. You may reshape the wall by spending a standard action in concentration.</p><p>2. If you spend 2 additional power points, the range of this power increases to Medium (100 ft. +10 ft./lvl.).</p><p>3. If you spend 2 additional power points, your control over the localized windstorm increases greatly. You may reshape the wall as normal or as an immediate action. You may also generate pockets of calm interspersed with pockets of intense winds when you shape the wall (effectively, this is the intensify option except that the wall may be broken with as many 5-foot cubes of calm that you choose, as per the pacify option). </p><p>4. For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can reduce the wind conditions an additional category when using the pacify option.</p><p>5.

You can affect both mundane and magical inanimate material. Weakening an object's substance decreases its hardness and hit points, and strengthening it increases its hardness and hit points. You can increase or decrease an object's hardness by up to 5 from its original hardness. When hardness increases, the object (or portion of an object) gains 3 hit points per inch of thickness for every point of increased hardness.

You cannot increase an object's hardness by more than 5 from the hardness of the original base object, nor decrease it by more than 5 from the hardness of the original base object. For example, you could not manifest this power twice to increase an object's hardness by 10, but could decrease the hardness by 5, then manifest again to increase the hardness by 5, and then manifest again to increase the hardness again by 5, because the change from the original base object's hardness is only 5.</p><p><b>Working Manipulated Metals</b></p><p>An object or portion thereof whose hardness is decreased or increased is permanently changed.

Although the subject starts off with memories of your experiences, it possesses its original \"soul\" and physical body and is free to develop its own personality based on its own new experiences. Thus, the subject is not your slave or servant, but instead a nonplayer character in its own right that shares your earlier memories.</p><p><i>Protection from evil</i> or a similar spell or power can prevent you from implanting <i>mind seed</i>, or prevent a seed from germinating while the protective power lasts. Otherwise, a germinating seed can be removed (prior to germination) only by <i>psychic chirurgery</i>, <i>reality revision</i>, or similarly high-level effects. Manifesting <i>mind seed</i> again during the germination period also cleanses the subject's mind and does not carry with it the restriction of a target of your size or smaller</p><p>The process of impressing your psyche into another is demanding and draining. You suffer one negative level that does not go away until cleansed by an effect such as <i>restoration</i>. Cleansing a mind seed does not bestow this penalty.</p><p>The target of this power must be your size or smaller. Effects active that modify your size do not modify this restriction; if you are normally Medium size, but under the effect of expansion, you may still only target a Medium or smaller humanoid.</p><p>This power does not have the evil descriptor when used to cleanse a mind seed.</p>","spellDuration":"Instantaneous, see text","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","showInQuickbar":false,"spellPoints":{"cost":"(@sl * 2) - 1"},"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/light-magenta-2.jpg","effects":[]}

For example, you could use foxhole to create a small trench or modify matter to create a stone building. When you finish manifesting this power, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any power or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes.

An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you manifest this power on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the power ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using bend reality, reality revision, or unravel psionics and making a successful dispel check.</p><p>If you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by manifesting the power again. Alternatively, you may manifest this power again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest manifesting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control.
